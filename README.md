# Customer Churn Prediction Using Deep Learning and Streamlit

## 📝 Overview
This project is a deep learning-based customer churn prediction system built using TensorFlow and Streamlit. It takes user inputs related to customer attributes and predicts the likelihood of churn using a pre-trained neural network model.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a trained TensorFlow model to predict churn probability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and simple UI.
- **Feature Encoding & Scaling**: Utilizes Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding, and Standardization.
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Provides instant churn probability based on user inputs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-Learn
- **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Python

## 📌 Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip


### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krishshah9944/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Streamlit.git
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning-and-Streamlit
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```


## 🎯 Usage Guide
1. **Enter Customer Details**: Provide relevant inputs like Credit Score, Age, Balance, etc.
2. **Get Prediction**: The model outputs a churn probability.
3. **Interpret Results**: If the probability is above 0.5, the customer is likely to churn.
